# Changelog

All notable changes to XML.jl will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Deprecated

- **`Cursor(data, startpos)`**, removed in v0.5: it is the only entry that exposes a byte offset into the source, and nothing in the package or in any registered dependent calls it. Line-end normalization only shortens, so the offset still translates; entity inclusion inserts, so an offset inside a replaced reference has no image. To walk a subtree, take a snapshot and cross back through it: `snapshot = LazyNode(cursor)`, then `Cursor(snapshot)`.

### Added

- **`XML.escape` and `XML.unescape` are now public API** ([#125](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/125)): declared `public` on Julia 1.11+ and covered by semver, for downstream code that assembles XML strings itself. They stay unexported — the bare names are too generic for `using XML`.

- **The W3C conformance testset now byte-compares parsed values against the suite's canonical `out/` references** ([#94](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/94)): 262 reference pairs in scope, 147 byte-identical, the other 115 ledgered as `@test_broken` under the conformance feature that closes each. The ported processing-instruction testsets assert upstream-expected values rather than node counts.

- **The benchmarks now cover the constructions their XMark-style document lacked** ([#138](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/138)): `XMarkGenerator.jl` gains opt-in features — references and character references in text, attribute values needing decoding or white-space normalization, comments, CDATA sections, processing instructions, a DOCTYPE — placed deterministically, so a generated twin keeps the document's elements and attributes in the same order; the default document is byte-identical. `profile.jl` measures every reader over the document and its two twins and the three `wellformed` levels, so the `:strict` figures of `PERFORMANCE-v0.4.md` come from a script and are corrected: 1.2× on the document and 14× on its character data alone, where the note said ~1.1× and ~20×. `flatnode_bench.jl` measures the eight entry points that had no cell. Tables 6 to 8 of `PERFORMANCE-v0.4.md` publish them.

### Fixed

- **The published libxml2 figures were measured with the C trees never freed** ([#138](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/138)): EzXML attaches its finalizer to a document's node, not to the document, so the `finalize(doc)` the benchmark cells relied on freed nothing, and a benchmark loop allocates too little in Julia to wake the collector; the trees piled up by the gigabyte within a cell until the machine compressed and swapped. Every C-tree cell now frees its tree per sample, outside the timing, and every figure in `README.md` and `PERFORMANCE-v0.4.md` is republished from one campaign: libxml2's build of the 14 MB document goes from a published 47.6 ms to 37.3 ms, its full extraction from 65 to 58 ms, and the XML.jl figures move within noise.

- **Internal general entities are included per XML 1.0 §4.4** ([#130](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/130)): a reference to an entity declared in a DOCTYPE internal subset came through as literal text — `&e;` — in every reader. Its replacement text is now included before the parse, so markup in that text produces structure rather than a text node holding `<`, and a reference in an attribute value resolves as well. **Any document that uses internal entities changes the values it reports.** Expansion is bounded at depth 40 and 64 MiB, so a [billion-laughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack) document raises an error rather than exhausting memory. A document read through a `StringView` over `Mmap` is covered by a package extension; one that declares no entities costs a single probe of its prolog, 18 ns on a 14 MB file. This turned 29 of the ledgered W3C canonical-reference gaps green.

- **`:strict` rejects a reference to an undeclared entity** ([#130](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/130)): XML 1.0 §4.1's well-formedness constraint *Entity Declared* — one even a non-validating processor must enforce, where a validity constraint binds only a validating one. It binds only where a missing name is certain, which needs every declaration the document has to be one this reader sees: a document with no DTD, or one whose declarations all sit in its internal subset with nothing pointing outside it — no external subset, no parameter-entity reference, no entity declared as external. Under any other shape a declaration never read could supply the name. Below `:strict` the reference stays literal, which is the behaviour every level had. This rejects eight more documents of the W3C not-well-formed suite, 408 of 1257.

- **`parse_dtd` no longer raises `StringIndexError` on a non-ASCII internal subset**: it walked the subset one byte at a time, so a multi-byte character inside a declaration left the index between the bytes of a character.

- **Line ends are now normalized per XML 1.0 §2.11** (all four readers): literal CR LF and lone CR read as LF — in character data, CDATA sections, processing-instruction data, comments, attribute values and the DOCTYPE value — while CR written as `&#13;` still reads as a real CR. Previously the raw bytes came through, so CR LF documents read differently in XML.jl than in conforming parsers. On write, a CR in text content is escaped as `&#13;`, so values round-trip exactly. This turned 62 of the ledgered W3C canonical-reference gaps green ([#129](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/129)).

- **The lazy readers no longer copy the document at the entry** ([#134](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/134)): `parse(str, LazyNode)` and `parse(str, Cursor)` converted their argument to a `String` — 59 MiB for a 59 MiB document — and now take it as given, keeping its type. That copy was masking a second cost: over a non-`String` source, `attributes` walked the whole document once per attribute, 109 ms for 2,000 elements where it now takes 1.4 ms.

- **A memory-mapped document is no longer copied into the heap when its lines end in CR** ([#135](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/135)): the entry rewrote it whatever string type held it, so mapping a Windows-written file asked for as much heap as the file. Only a `String` document is rewritten now; any other source has each value normalized as it is read. Opening the mapped 14 MB document goes from 51.6 ms and 13.8 MiB to 24 ns and no copy. `sourcetext` reports the bytes of the document the reader holds, so a mapped document shows the file's own line ends.

- **`unescape` allocated about six times per value carrying a reference** ([#141](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/141)): it copied its argument to a `String`, ran a regular-expression `replace` and built a string per character reference, in every reader. It now decodes in one pass over the bytes and allocates once, the result; a value whose `&` starts no reference is returned as it is. On the escaped twin of the benchmarks, a `Cursor` pass drops from 269,015 to 46,584 allocations and from 38.2 to 30.7 ms; on a value of a spreadsheet cell's shape, from 171 to 34 ns per call.

- **The `:strict` reference check allocated about seven times per reference** ([#142](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/142)): it matched a regular expression per reference in every token carrying a `&`, in the `Node` and `FlatNode` parses alike. It now reads the token's bytes and allocates nothing, so `:strict` allocates exactly what `:structural` does; what it accepts and rejects is unchanged. On the escaped twin of the benchmarks, `parse(…, Node; wellformed = :strict)` goes from 3,241,570 to 2,658,494 allocations and from 89.8 to 68.9 ms. The decoder behind `unescape` and the check now share one reader of references.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **Julia 1.10 builds mis-executed downstream worksheet scans** — XLSX.jl workbook opens failed with `No sheetData node found in worksheet` ([XLSX.jl#448](https://github.com/JuliaData/XLSX.jl/issues/448)): a Julia 1.10 compilation defect triggered by v0.4.5's branchless span fallback. The 1.10 build now selects the earlier two-branch body (1.11+ builds are unchanged), and the Downstream and default-bounds CI jobs also run on LTS.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **GC-tuning note in PERFORMANCE-v0.4.md**: `--gcthreads=4` cuts a full collection with a
  large live `Node` tree ~2.7× on the benchmark document, at no cost to computation —
  measured guidance for applications that hold big trees.

### Changed

- **`LazyNode` iteration is allocation-light, with its shared-cursor semantics pinned**:
  the child, element, and attribute iterators hold the tokenizer's isbits state as inline
  fields — no per-call mutable tokenizer wrapper, no heap `RefValue` cursor, no boxed
  tuple per step. Pulling children through an iterator allocates nothing; creating one
  costs a single small object, elided where it never loops. Every loop over the same
  iterator object resumes where the previous one stopped — the contract downstream row
  streams (XLSX.jl) rely on, now pinned in tests. A full lazy traversal of the 14 MB
  benchmark document drops from 2.6 M allocations / 121 MiB of garbage to 273 K / 21 MiB,
  median −23 % (#118, #119, #121).

- **The `Node` build no longer allocates per-element vectors**: children and attributes
  accumulate on parse-wide scratch stacks, sliced out exact-size at each closing tag. On
  the 14 MB benchmark document: ~380 K allocations and ~22 MiB of garbage less per build,
  median build −7.5 %, retained tree 80.0 → 71.6 MiB, full walks ~1.4× faster (#107).

- **Views are span-native end to end**: tokens carry `(offset, ncodeunits)` byte spans,
  and every view — `raw`, the tag/attribute/PI accessors, `FlatNode`'s span→view
  helpers — is rebuilt by direct field construction, with no `prevind`/`nextind` walks.
  Sound because every span edge falls on an ASCII byte or EOF, hence a UTF-8 character
  boundary; `--check-bounds=yes` builds (as in `Pkg.test`) compile the checked
  reconstruction instead, selected at load time. On the 14 MB document: lex 37.4 → 23.4 ms,
  `FlatNode` extract 6.6 → 3.1 ms, and two orderings reverse — `FlatNode` builds ~1.7×
  faster than libxml2 and extracts faster than `Node`'s direct field reads — while
  pure-Julia streaming is ~2.5× faster than EzXML's `StreamReader`. Allocations
  unchanged throughout (#109, #111, #113).

- **Measurement upkeep**: every timing in PERFORMANCE-v0.4.md and the README is a
  BenchmarkTools `@benchmark` median (`benchmarks/flatnode_bench.jl` rewritten
  accordingly); the cross-library suite bounds its own C heap (per-sample `finalize`
  teardown, between-cell collection) so a full run no longer pages the machine;
  sub-millisecond README rows are quoted in microseconds (#107, #110); and the
  decomposed pipeline reports the absolute allocation count of every cell and gains a
  per-reader whole-tree traversal section — a per-node cost hides in a ratio but not in
  a counter (#120).

### Fixed

- **`simple_value(::FlatNode)` no longer heap-allocates on default-bounds builds** —
  32 B per call on the build users actually run, a regression the span-native rerouting
  introduced and that neither `Pkg.test` (which forces `--check-bounds=yes`) nor
  coverage CI could see. A new CI job now runs the suite on the default-bounds build
  with the allocation guards active, and the `Node` build gains an allocation ceiling
  pinning its scratch-stack contract (#122).

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **By-key attribute access, completed across readers** — one rule: the key's type selects
  the axis (an `Int` indexes the child sequence, `:` takes it whole, a `String` looks up the
  attribute map, `get` being the default-on-a-miss variant). `FlatNode` gains
  `n["key"]`/`get`/`haskey`/`keys` (attribute-range scan, only the matched value decoded)
  plus the `n[:]`/`n[end]`/`only` child-axis forms; `Cursor` gains `getindex`/`haskey`/`keys`
  beside its existing `get`, on the current node (#100).

### Changed

- **The performance tables decompose garbage collection**: every timed row in
  PERFORMANCE-v0.4.md now reads `total (GC x)` under a `time (incl. GC)` header — the total
  is what a user lives, the GC share is the per-session draw, and their difference is the
  reproducible work time. The benchmark harnesses (`profile.jl`, `flatnode_bench.jl`) print
  the decomposition; `flatnode_bench.jl` reports the median run's own pair.

### Fixed

- **The decoded read surface is now allocation-free** on the three zero-copy readers
  (`LazyNode`, `FlatNode`, `Cursor`): `n["key"]`/`get`/`haskey`, `value`,
  `simple_value`/`is_simple_value` and `eachattribute` no longer heap-box their result on
  entity-free content — previously 32–320 B on every call, the same type-instability
  phenomenon the v0.4.3 normalization fix removed (#98): `unescape`'s union return, the
  `getindex` sentinel default, and small unions crossing non-inlined call boundaries.
  `simple_value(::LazyNode)` now runs the same single-pass token walk as
  `is_simple_value` instead of materializing `attributes` and `children`. On the 14 MB
  benchmark document, a full `Cursor` streaming pass now allocates nothing at all (was
  17 MiB) and runs ~14 % faster, and the `FlatNode` value-extraction stage drops ~30 %
  (9.3 → 6.6 ms). Allocation guards in the test suite pin every accessor at zero (#105).
- **`foreach_attr`'s docstring no longer recommends the internal tokenizer layer**
  (`XML.XMLTokenizer.raw`/`attr_value`) — a workaround from before the decoded surface
  was allocation-free, and a semantic trap: `attr_value` only strips the quotes,
  performing no character-reference resolution and no XML 1.0 §3.3.3 white-space
  normalization. The docstring now points to `eachattribute` (decoded, equally
  allocation-free) and spells out the raw-layer caveat (#104).

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **`sourcespan(n) -> UnitRange{Int}`** on the two source-retaining readers (`LazyNode`,
  `FlatNode`): the range of *valid character indices* the node's original source text
  occupies, with the invariant `sourcetext(n) == SubString(source, sourcespan(n))` — the
  library does the `prevind` computation, so multi-byte boundaries are safe to slice and
  splice around. O(1) on `FlatNode` (answered from the stored per-record spans). For
  consumers that need a node's *position* rather than its text — verbatim excision and
  splicing without reaching into reader internals (#92).
- **`splicetext(n, replacement = "")`** on the same two readers: the document source with
  the node's own text replaced — excised entirely by default. The packaged, multi-byte-safe
  form of the `sourcespan` splice (#92).

### Changed

- **`LazyNode`'s child iterator defers each yielded element's subtree skip** until the
  next sibling is requested: a traversal that stops early only tokenizes the bytes it
  actually stepped over, making descents O(bytes before the target) — touching a 14 MB
  document's root element drops from ~35 ms to ~4 µs, a nine-node document-order descent
  from ~50 ms to ~5 µs. Full traversals do the same total work as before (#91).

### Fixed

- **Attribute values are now normalized per XML 1.0 §3.3.3** (all four readers): literal
  tab/newline/CR in an attribute value read as spaces — the CR LF pair as a single space —
  while white space written as character references (`&#9;` `&#10;` `&#13;`) still reads
  as the referenced character. Previously the raw characters came through, so a document
  with attributes wrapped across lines read differently in XML.jl than in conforming
  parsers such as libxml2. On write, attribute values now escape literal tab/newline/CR as
  character references, so values round-trip exactly (#93).

- **`parse(str, Cursor)`, `read(filename, Cursor)`, `read(io, Cursor)`** — `Cursor` gains the
  tree readers' entry points: same argument order, and the `read` forms apply the same
  byte-level BOM normalization (UTF-8 BOM strip, UTF-16 LE/BE transcoding; a BOM-less UTF-16
  file now gets the explicit `"UTF-16 without a BOM is not well-formed (XML 1.0 §4.3.3)"`
  error instead of a cryptic tokenizer one). `Cursor(str)` and `parse(Cursor, str)` are
  unchanged (#89).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **`FlatNode` — a fourth reader: read-only columnar full-DOM** (`parse(xml, FlatNode)`,
  `read(file, FlatNode)`). The whole document is materialized once into a contiguous store of
  isbits records (zero-copy byte ranges into the retained source; text/attribute values
  entity-decoded on access), so building is fast, random access is O(1), and the GC sees a
  handful of arrays instead of one object per node — *`Node`'s read half at `Cursor`'s GC
  cost*. Extras over `Node`: O(1) `parent`, O(depth) 1-arg `depth`. By design: read-only,
  whole-store retention, 2 GiB/`typemax(Int32)` limits (use `Node` beyond). `Node(flatnode)`
  materializes a handle as a mutable `Node`; `XML.write` accepts `FlatNode` directly. Same
  well-formedness levels and error messages as the `Node` parser. **Marked experimental**
  while its usage settles in the dependent ecosystem: API details may still change in a
  0.4.x release (#82).

- **`issamenode(a, b)` — positional identity for the handle readers** (`FlatNode`: same
  store + same index; `LazyNode`: same source object + same token): "is this the same node
  of the same document", which neither `==` (structural equality) nor `===` (egal is
  content-based on immutable handles) can express (#83).

### Changed

- **`==`/`isequal`/`hash` are structural for every tree reader, cross-reader included** —
  same decoded nodetype/tag/attributes (order-insensitive)/value/children (in document
  order), recursively. `Node` already compared structurally; `LazyNode` (previously the
  default egal fallback) now matches it, the new `FlatNode` has these semantics
  from the start, and `Node == LazyNode == FlatNode` holds for equal content (#83).

- **Search-based `Node` navigation raises an error on indistinguishable occurrences**:
  `parent`/`depth`/`siblings`/XPath `..` match by egal, which is content-based on parsed
  immutable nodes — in a tree with several value-identical occurrences (e.g. twin
  `<item/>` elements) they silently answered for the first match, yielding wrong depths
  and sibling lists. Unambiguous calls are unchanged. Migration: for positional navigation
  in such documents, use `FlatNode` (parent links, no ambiguity).

### Fixed

- **`hash(::Node)` restores the `==`/`hash` contract** (#55): `Node` compared structurally
  but hashed by `objectid`, so `unique`/`Dict`/`Set` misbehaved on equal nodes.

### Internal

- Source layout: the `src/XML.jl` monolith (1409 lines) is split into dedicated files —
  `escape.jl`, `node.jl`, `write.jl`, `parse.jl`, `dtd.jl` — alongside the existing
  `XMLTokenizer.jl`/`lazynode.jl`/`cursor.jl`/`xpath.jl`. Pure moves, no behavior change;
  `src/XML.jl` is now the commented include manifest.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- `eachelement(node)` / `elements(node)` — element-only child iteration for `Node` and
  `LazyNode`, skipping the whitespace `Text` nodes that v0.4 preserves on pretty-printed
  documents (and any other non-element node). The explicit idiom for the common
  "iterate the child elements" loop ([#78](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl/issues/78)).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-03

> **Upgrading from 0.3.x?** See the standalone [v0.4 migration guide](MIGRATING_TO_v0.4.md).

### Added
- New streaming tokenizer (`XMLTokenizer` module) for fine-grained XML token iteration.
- Pull/cursor streaming API — `Cursor` with `next!`, `for_each_child` / `@for_each_child`,
  `skip_element!`, and `eof` for forward, allocation-light traversal of large documents ([#8], [#61]).
- XPath support via `xpath(node, path)` — an experimental subset of XPath 1.0 ([#30]).
- Configurable well-formedness: `parse`/`read` accept `wellformed = :lenient | :structural | :strict`
  (default `:structural`).
- `get(node, key, default)` accessor, matching `getindex` ([#50]).
- `test/test_libxml2_testcases.jl`: 243 test cases borrowed from the [libxml2](https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2) test suite.
- `AbstractTrees` package extension (`print_tree`, `PreOrderDFS`, `Leaves`, … on `Node` and `LazyNode`).

### Changed
- **`Node` is now parametric `Node{S}`** (storage type `S`, typically `String` or `SubString{String}`)
  and is no longer a subtype of `AbstractXMLNode`. `::Node` annotations continue to work.
- **A `Node`'s `attributes` field is now a `Vector{Pair{S,S}}`** (was `OrderedDict{String,String}`).
  Use the `attributes(node)` accessor — which returns an ordered `Attributes <: AbstractDict`, or
  `nothing` — instead of indexing the field directly.
- **`LazyNode` is now an immutable `LazyNode{S}`** constructed with `parse(x, LazyNode)` /
  `read(file, LazyNode)`; the `.raw` field is removed and accessors return `SubString` views.
- **`XML.write` now escapes text and attribute values automatically**, and `parse`/`read` unescape
  into values — so `value(node)` returns decoded text (`&`, not `&amp;`). Round-trips are preserved
  because `write` re-escapes.
- **Duplicate attribute names now raise an error** during parsing.
- **`parse`/`read` reject malformed documents by default** (`wellformed = :structural`): multiple
  root elements, a document with no root element, non-whitespace text outside the root, empty/invalid
  element names, a literal `<` in an attribute value, and a misplaced/duplicate/nested DOCTYPE or XML
  declaration. `:strict` additionally rejects `--` (or a trailing `-`) in comments, empty/invalid PI
  targets, and characters — numeric references *and* raw literal characters — outside the XML §2.2
  `Char` range. Pass `wellformed = :lenient` to restore the previous permissive behavior; note that a
  standalone DTD file or a prolog-only fragment (no root element) now needs `:lenient`.
- **`Node` constructors validate names and content.** Element/PI names must be valid XML names, and
  `Comment`/`CData`/`ProcessingInstruction` content may not contain its own close delimiter (`-->`,
  `]]>`, `?>`), which would otherwise split the node on write. (Content is not otherwise validated —
  e.g. a `Comment` whose text contains `--` is constructed as-is and is rejected only on re-parse at
  `:strict`.)
- **`escape` is no longer idempotent** — every `&` is escaped, so `escape("&amp;") == "&amp;amp;"`;
  call it only on raw, unescaped text ([#52]).
- **`read` no longer memory-maps** the input file.
- **Minimum Julia version is now 1.10.**

### Deprecated
- `simplevalue` — already a deprecated alias of `simple_value` *before* 0.4 — is **no longer exported** (it stays
  reachable as `XML.simplevalue`, still warning). Use `simple_value`. *(Not a new 0.4 deprecation: the rename to the
  snake_case `simple_value`, matching `is_simple` / `is_simple_value`, predates this release; 0.4 only un-exports the
  old alias.)*

### Removed
- **`XML.Raw`** and the Raw/LazyNode streaming internals — use `parse(x, Node)` / `read(file, Node)`
  for an in-memory tree, or the new `Cursor` API for streaming.
- **`next` / `prev`** (LazyNode traversal), and **`prev!`** (the 0.3.x in-place `LazyNode` advance) —
  parse to a `Node` and use `children` / integer indexing, or the `Cursor` API. (`next!` still exists
  but now advances a `Cursor`, not a `LazyNode`; there is no `prev!` — `Cursor` is forward-only.)
- **Single-argument `parent(node)` / `depth(node)`** — use `parent(child, root)` / `depth(child, root)`.
- **`nodes_equal(a, b)`** — use `a == b`.
- **`escape!` / `unescape!`** — escaping/unescaping now happens automatically in `write` / `parse`.
- **`DTDBody`** — use `parse_dtd` or the `DTD` node.

  (Calling a removed function throws an error whose message names the replacement; `DTDBody` is
  removed outright and raises `UndefVarError`. These removals are all consequences of the v0.4 internals
  rewrite ([#54]); none has a dedicated issue to link individually.)

### Fixed
- **Tokenizer: multi-byte UTF-8 in attribute values** — values like `<doc city="東京"/>` no longer
  raise `StringIndexError` (`attr_value()` used byte arithmetic instead of `prevind`).
- **Tokenizer: quotes inside DTD comments** — a `"`/`'` inside a `<!-- -->` comment in a DTD internal
  subset no longer triggers an "Unterminated quoted string" error.
- Numeric character references are now escaped/unescaped correctly ([#17]).
- `unescape` no longer double-unescapes; each reference is processed exactly once ([#53]). It is now
  single-pass, so a numeric reference resolving to `&` is never re-scanned as a named entity —
  `unescape("&#38;amp;")` is `"&amp;"`, not `"&"`.
- A leading U+FEFF byte-order-mark character in an in-memory string is now stripped by
  `parse(_, LazyNode)` and `Cursor` as well as `parse(_, Node)`, so all three readers agree.
- A truncated comment/CDATA/PI/DOCTYPE at end of input raises a clear "unterminated …" error instead
  of being silently accepted (`Node`) or crashing `value()` (`LazyNode`/`Cursor`).
- Odd-length UTF-16 input that begins with a BOM raises a clear error instead of an opaque
  `reinterpret` failure.
- Processing-instruction content keeps its trailing whitespace on round-trip (only the leading
  separator after the target is dropped, per §2.6).
- `parse_dtd` reports a clear error on parameter-entity references (`%name;`) instead of an opaque
  internal error.
- XPath: unsupported axis syntax (`child::`, `descendant::`, …) now raises instead of silently
  returning the wrong result; dead scaffolding in `xpath` was removed.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-06-20

First release since XML.jl moved to [JuliaData](https://github.com/JuliaData/XML.jl) (transferred from JuliaComputing).

### Added
- `next!` and `prev!` for in-place, zero-allocation forward/backward traversal of `LazyNode` ([#59]).

### Fixed
- CDATA sections are now read and written with the spec-correct `<![CDATA[ … ]]>` delimiter.
  The previous `<![CData[` spelling is invalid XML and did not interoperate with other parsers ([#56]).
- `escape` now accepts any `AbstractString` (e.g. `SubString`), not only `String` ([#60]).

### Changed
- Relaxed the OrderedCollections.jl compat bound to include v2 ([#64]).

## [0.3.8]

### Fixed
- `XML.write` now respects `xml:space="preserve"` and suppresses indentation for elements with this attribute ([#49]).

## [0.3.7]

### Fixed
- Resolved remaining issues from [#45] and fixed [#46] (whitespace preservation edge cases) ([#47]).

## [0.3.6]

### Added
- `XML.write` respects `xml:space="preserve"` on elements, suppressing automatic indentation ([#45]).

### Fixed
- `String` type ambiguity on Julia nightly resolved ([#38]).

## [0.3.5]

### Fixed
- `depth` and `parent` functions corrected to work properly with the DOM tree API ([#37]).
- `escape` updated to no longer be idempotent — every `&` is now escaped, matching spec behavior ([#32], addressing [#31]).
- `pushfirst!` support added for `Node` children ([#29]).

## [0.3.4]

### Fixed
- Fixed [#26].
- CI updated to use `julia-actions/cache@v4` and `lts` Julia version.

## [0.3.3]

### Added

### Fixed
- Path definition error in README example ([#20]).

## [0.3.2]

### Fixed
- Minor typos.
